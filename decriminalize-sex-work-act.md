THE DECRIMINALIZE SEX WORK ACT

Whereas, prominent and widely-respected health, human rights, and civil liberties advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch, UNAIDS, and the World Health Organization have expressed support for the decriminalization of the adult consensual sex trade.

Whereas, the empirical evidence across a variety of criminalized, partially criminalized, decriminalized, and legalized settings demonstrate increased harms to sex workers as a result of enforcing prohibitions or regulations on consensual sex work.

Whereas, criminalizing sex work criminalizes a means of survival for marginalized people, and it makes LGBTQ people especially vulnerable to police harassment and arrest based on their gender expression and sexuality.

Whereas, the criminalization of sex work, including sex buying, has been shown to increase the risk of violence and threats to the safety of sex workers.

Whereas, even when clients are the stated target of police, sex workers remain at a heightened risk of violence. Both the buying and selling sides of the sex trade must be decriminalized.

Whereas, the decriminalization of the sex trade in other jurisdictions has been linked to decreases in crimes committed against sex workers, such as assault, extortion, and rape, including such crimes committed by police officers against sex workers, and also a decrease in associated issues such as drug abuse.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work makes it more likely that sex workers will report crimes that they experience or are witness to, leading to improved public and personal safety.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work is linked to decreases in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, since sex workers have more options for screening their clients and accessing vital health care services.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work leads to more stable, legal income and autonomy for sex workers, improving their financial standing and ability to positively contribute back to their community.

Whereas, research suggests that the decriminalization of sex work does not necessarily increase rates of sex slavery and non-consensual sex work.

Whereas, rather than have resources depleted by investigating, arresting, prosecuting, and punishing consenting adults involved in the sex trade, law enforcement should focus on preventing and prosecuting non-consensual sex crimes against adults and minors, including sexual assault, rape, and slavery.
