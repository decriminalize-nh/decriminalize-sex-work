THE SEX WORK DECRIMINALIZATION ACT

Whereas, prominent and widely-respected health, human rights, and civil liberties advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch, UNAIDS, and the World Health Organization have expressed support for the decriminalization of the adult consensual sex trade.

Whereas, the empirical evidence across a variety of criminalized, partially criminalized, decriminalized, and legalized settings demonstrate increased harms to sex workers as a result of enforcing prohibitions or regulations on consensual sex work.

Whereas, criminalizing sex work criminalizes a means of survival for marginalized people, and it makes LGBTQ people especially vulnerable to police harassment and arrest based on their gender expression and sexuality.

Whereas, the criminalization of sex work, including sex buying, has been shown to increase the risk of violence and threats to the safety of sex workers.

Whereas, even when clients are the stated target of police, sex workers remain at a heightened risk of violence. Both the buying and selling sides of the sex trade must be decriminalized.

Whereas, the decriminalization of the sex trade in other jurisdictions has been linked to decreases in crimes committed against sex workers, such as assault, extortion, and rape, including such crimes committed by police officers against sex workers, and also a decrease in associated issues such as drug abuse.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work makes it more likely that sex workers will report crimes that they experience or are witness to, leading to improved public and personal safety.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work is linked to decreases in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, since sex workers have more options for screening their clients and accessing vital health care services.

Whereas, the decriminalization of sex work leads to more stable, legal income and autonomy for sex workers, improving their financial standing and ability to positively contribute back to their community.

Whereas, research suggests that the decriminalization of sex work does not necessarily increase rates of sex slavery and non-consensual sex work.

Whereas, rather than have resources depleted by investigating, arresting, prosecuting, and punishing consenting adults involved in the sex trade, law enforcement should focus on preventing and prosecuting non-consensual sex crimes against adults and minors, including sexual assault, rape, and slavery.

The People of New Hampshire therefore propose this Sex Work Decriminalization Act of 20XX to end the criminalization of adult consensual sex work in New Hampshire, keeping legitimate entrepreneurs, workers, and customers out of the black market and focusing law enforcement resources on non-consensual sex crimes.

SEX WORK JUSTICE FUND

Section 3. (1) The people of New Hampshire recognize that sex work prohibition has had long-lasting negative impacts on affected communities, leading to a significant financial burden borne by arrestees, convicts, and their families.

(2) The exact financial cost to victims of sex work prohibition is logistically difficult to the point of being practically impossible to quantify in exact amounts. We cannot know what opportunities have been lost due to an arrest or conviction. Still, we cannot allow this difficulty to stop us from attempting to right the wrongs that victims of sex work prohibition have suffered.

(3) The people of New Hampshire desire to provide some justice to the victims of sex work prohibition by providing direct cash compensation through a new fund, the Sex Work Justice Fund, in hopes that this money will help them rebuild their lives and give them hope for a better future in a post-prohibition world.

(4) Money for the Fund will come from the savings to New Hampshire taxpayers by ending sex work prohibition.

(5) Money allocated to the Fund shall be distributed as follows:

(a) 90% of the Fund shall be used to provide direct cash payments either (i) to anyone previously convicted as an adult, or adjudicated as a minor, prior to November 1, 20XX, for any crime repealed by this Act, or (ii) to their next of kin if the arrestee/convict/adjudicated minor has passed away within the last fifty years, or (iii) to their legal guardian if they are otherwise unable to accept the payment directly.

(b) The remaining 10% of the Fund shall be used to provide direct cash payments to any law enforcement officers who have been physically or emotionally harmed in the line of duty while enforcing any of the crimes repealed by this Act.

(c) Proof of eligibility must be submitted along with any claims requests, and these proofs must be verified by the government before money from the Fund is distributed for this cause. If the claim is not verified or denied within 90 days of receipt, the claim shall automatically be approved and funds paid retroactive to the initial date of the claim.

(c) Funding shall be divided equally between all claimants each annual period, and there shall be a cap on funding going to each recipient of $74,991 per year (the 2018 median income in New Hampshire). Once enrolled as a claimant, payments from the Fund shall continue automatically until the end of the program. It is the responsibility of each claimant to update their payment details with the relevant government department if any update is needed.

(d) Any money leftover at the end of the Fund's five year term will be transferred to the General Fund.

(1)(a) Within 180 days of the end of the first year in which this Act becomes effective, and within 180 days of the end of each subsequent year for the next five years, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant shall calculate the savings to the State of New Hampshire resulting from the repeal of statutes specified in section 1, including any savings resulting from reductions in arrests, incarceration, and supervision.

(b) The savings shall be calculated based on a comparison of the most recent year concluded at the time the calculation is made and the year immediately preceding the year in which this Act became effective.

(2) In making the calculations set forth in this section, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant shall use actual data. The Office of Legislative Budget Assistant may use best available estimates where actual data is unavailable.

Section 7. Moneys transferred to the Sex Work Justice Fund and distributed pursuant to section 4 shall, to the maximum extent consistent with law, be in addition to and not in replacement of any existing allocations or appropriations for the purposes of providing social services to sex workers, including subsidized health care, sex education, sexually transmitted infection prevention programs, substance use disorder treatment, peer support and recovery services, transitional, supportive, and permanent housing for persons with substance use disorders, and harm reduction interventions.
